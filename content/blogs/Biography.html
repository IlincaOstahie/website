<h2>Finding my Passion</h2>
<p>Outside of my school life, my hobbies include acting and aerial sports. I started theatre acting at 14 years old, time in which I studied the Stanislavski acting method, as well as the works of Anton Chekhov, Ion Luca Caragiale and others. Acting has helped me improve my interpersonal skills, as well as non-verbal communication skills, alongside allowing me to explore my more creative side.
