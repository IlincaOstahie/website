## Introduction

My name Ilinca Ostahie, candidate at London Business School MFA. I am originally from Bucharest, Romania, and speak 4 languages; Romanian, English, Spanish and French.

## Exploring My Horizon

When I moved to London, I had little clue about the career path I wanted to follow further in life, but I did know that London was the place to explore all my possibilities, and I have since encountered amazing opportunities, such as being a student in Kostisâ€™ world-renowned data analytics class!

## Finding my Passion

Outside of my school life, my hobbies include acting and aerial sports. I started theatre acting at 14 years old, time in which I studied the Stanislavski acting method, as well as the works of Anton Chekhov, Ion Luca Caragiale and others. Acting has helped me improve my interpersonal skills, as well as non-verbal communication skills, alongside allowing me to explore my more creative side.
